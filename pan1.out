	+ Partial Order Reduction

Full statespace search for:
	never claim         	+ (e1)
	assertion violations	+ (if within scope of claim)
	acceptance   cycles 	+ (fairness enabled)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by never claim)

State-vector 36 byte, depth reached 317, errors: 0
      819 states, stored
      740 states, matched
     1559 transitions (= stored+matched)
        0 atomic steps
hash conflicts:         0 (resolved)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.050	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    0.281	actual memory usage for states
  128.000	memory used for hash table (-w24)
    0.534	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
